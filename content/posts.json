      "summary": "The UK’s Project Gigabit programme remains one of the most ambitious infrastructure initiatives ever undertaken, with the goal of delivering gigabit-capable broadband to some of the hardest-to-reach communities in the country.\nWhile significant progress has been made, millions of premises remain unbuilt across rural and semi-rural areas. For contractors and delivery partners involved in these programmes, the challenge is no longer just about securing work — it’s about delivering at scale, at pace, and under increasing scrutiny.\n\nThe reality on the ground\nProject Gigabit delivery is characterised by:\n•\tComplex, dispersed build areas.\n•\tMultiple delivery lots and overlapping contracts.\n•\tTight build windows and milestone-based funding\n•\tIncreasing focus on assurance, reporting and compliance\n•\tPressure on productivity, resourcing and commercial control\nAs programmes mature, expectations rise. Authorities, suppliers and delivery partners all require clear evidence of progress, control and compliance — not just outputs at the end of the build.\n\nWhere delivery starts to strain\nMany contractors are still relying on:\n•\tSpreadsheets for tracking progress and resources\n•\tDisconnected GIS, permit and field systems.\n•\tManual reporting for assurance and governance\n•\tLimited real-time visibility of site activity\nThese approaches can work at small scale, but Project Gigabit demands consistency and control across hundreds or thousands of premises, often spread across wide geographies.\n\nThis is where delivery risk increases:\n•\tDelays are harder to spot early.\n•\tProductivity issues surface too late.\n•\tPermit and site data becomes fragmented.\n•\tReporting becomes reactive rather than proactive.\n\nHow Glidepath supports Project Gigabit delivery\nGlidepath was designed specifically for utilities and fibre-network delivery programmes operating at scale.\nFor contractors working on Project Gigabit schemes, Glidepath provides:\n•\tA single operational view of planned, live and completed works.\n•\tDirect integration with GIS systems to reflect real network progress.\n•\tEnd-to-end management of work instructions permits and site activity.\n•\tReal-time visibility of crew activity, delays and risks\n•\tStructured capture of site evidence and audit records\n•\tClear reporting that supports assurance, governance and funding milestones\n\nRather than replacing existing systems, Glidepath connects planning, field delivery and management oversight, helping teams stay in control as programmes grow in size and complexity.\n\nSupporting delivery — not adding overhead\nOne of the biggest concerns for contractors is introducing new systems mid-programme. Glidepath is built to be:\n•\tQuick to implement.\n•\tSimple for field teams to adopt.\n•\tFlexible enough to align with existing delivery models.\nThe aim is not to add bureaucracy, but to reduce manual effort, improve visibility and give delivery teams the confidence that nothing critical is being missed.\n\nLooking ahead\nWith large volumes of Project Gigabit premises still to be delivered, the coming years will be defined by:\n•\tSustained build intensity\n•\tIncreased focus on performance and assurance\n•\tThe need for scalable, repeatable delivery models\nContractors that can demonstrate control, transparency and consistency will be best placed to succeed as the programme continues.\n\nWant to learn more?\nIf you’re involved in Project Gigabit delivery and want to understand how Glidepath can support your operational management, get in touch or explore the platform further on our website.\n",
